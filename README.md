# GNSS Measurement Engine System Design: Communication Engineering Perpsectives

The key GNSS measurement engine design parameters are sensitivity (or link budget), accuracy or error budget, and power consumption (or energy budget, power budget or battery life).

## Sensitivity
The system design for a GPS receiver sensitivity traditionally is understood from a signal processing perspective. It is pretty much the same as the link budget modelling used in wireless communication system designs, in which the mutual coupling between a transmitter and a receiver is modelled, itemized and computed.  

## Accuracy

## Power Consumption
